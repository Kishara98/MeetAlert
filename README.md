## Features

- Displays upcoming Google Meet meetings directly on your desktop.
- Automatically fetches meetings from Google Calendar.
- Updates every hour to check for new meetings.
- Easy to use with a lightweight Tkinter-based UI.

## Prerequisites

Before running the widget, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or later
- [Google Cloud Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with Google Calendar API enabled.
- Required Python libraries:
  - `google-api-python-client`
  - `google-auth-httplib2`
  - `google-auth-oauthlib`
  - `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python on most platforms)

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kishara98/MeetAlert.git
    cd MeetAlert-master
    ```

2. **Create a Google Cloud Project** and enable the Google Calendar API:

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project.
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Library**, search for "Google Calendar API", and enable it.
   - Go to **Credentials** and create **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs** for a **Desktop App**.
   - Download the `credentials.json` file and place it in the root directory of this project.

3. **Install the required dependencies** using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(Create a `requirements.txt` with the following content)*:
    ```
    google-api-python-client
    google-auth-httplib2
    google-auth-oauthlib
    tk
    ```

4. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python desktop_meeting_notifier.py
    ```

    The first time you run the app, it will open a browser window asking you to authenticate with your Google account. After that, a `token.json` file will be generated for subsequent runs.

## Usage

Once the app is authenticated, it will fetch upcoming Google Meet meetings for the next hour and display them in a Tkinter-based widget on your desktop. The widget refreshes the meeting list at regular intervals.



## Customization

You can modify the widgetâ€™s refresh interval or display settings by editing the `show_meetings()` function inside the Python script.

### Adding Auto-Refresh (Optional)

If you want the widget to automatically refresh every 5 minutes, you can add the following line to the `show_meetings()` function:

```python
root.after(300000, show_meetings)  # Refresh every 5 minutes
```
